# Containers Technologies
Containers have been in place since 2008, Docker is quite new and not the only solution.

## Containerization
- Usual competitor: VM
- Host OS + Hypervisor
- Node.js App: 15MB, but VM: 400MB!
- Scaling: have to create more VM's ! 
- + -> I created Node.js on mac, now push on Linux -> issues ... 
Solution: Containers\\

3 steps
1. Manifest (decribes the container itself)
    - In docker: dockerfile
    - In cloudfoundry: manifest.yml 
2. Image itself 
    - Docker: Docker Image
    - Rocket: ACI (application container image)
3. Container Itself
    - Contains Runtime
    - Binaries
    - Libraries

- Instead of supervisor now have runtime engine (Docker: Docker Engine)
- We create a manifest, push registry and push image
- Much more lightweight

Imagine now we want to integrate a third-party app that does image recognition
- We create a python service that uses the third-party through API
- In the VM case, we would create a VM that integrates the Node.js+Python combined
    - That's not cloud native
    - Because cannot scale the js only and not the python
    - The only true "cloud native" way is to make a new VM for the python service
    
- In the Container case, we just deploy 1 copy of the Python script
- Then other containers access it 

Other great thing about containers: 
- if 1 container isn't using as much resources, everything is shared so other containers can use it ! 

## Container Orchestration
- Imagine FrontEnd+BackEnd+DB
    - A dev would focus on this 
    
- On the bottom we would have a "master" for the orchestration 
- For example Kubernetes

Operations Team would have a global view on it
- Don't see containers, 
- But see:
    - VMs (worker nodes in Kubernetes)
    - Each worker node can 'run' different applications (1 FrontEnd & 2 BackEnds for example)
- If we're using a signigicant amont of processing power on our node 
    - We scale our application 
    - We can scale our different containers differently (2x Front, 3x Back for eg)
- We don't need to go and check if our Backend nÂ°2 is running: orchestration platform does that for us 
- We instead have access to 1 point of contact for each service (all backs, all fronts etc) 
    
Orchestration: 
1. Deploy
2. Scale
3. Network
4. Insight
