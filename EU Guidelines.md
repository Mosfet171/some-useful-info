# Recent ICT-related EU Guidelines 

## üîê DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)
* Target audience: Financial sector only (banks, insurance, investment firms, fintech, etc.)
* Goal: Ensure digital operational resilience of financial entities
* Focus:
	* ICT risk management
	* Incident reporting
	* Resilience testing
	* Third-party risk (especially cloud providers)
	* Information sharing
* Applies to: Both financial institutions and certain ICT service providers to the financial sector
* In force since: January 2023 (full compliance by January 2025)

## üõ°Ô∏è NIS2 (Network and Information Security Directive 2)
* Target audience: Critical infrastructure and essential/important entities across many sectors
(e.g., energy, transport, health, water, telecom, digital services, public administration)
* Goal: Improve overall cybersecurity posture across the EU
* Focus:
	* Cyber risk management
	* Incident handling and notification
	* Supply chain security
	* Governance and accountability
	* EU-wide cooperation and enforcement
* Applies to: Much broader set of sectors than DORA
* In force since: January 2023 (implementation deadline October 2024)

## üÜö Main Differences
Feature	     | DORA	 | NIS2
-------      | ----- | ------
Who it covers| 	Financial sector + ICT providers|	Essential/important entities across sectors
Focus|	Digital resilience (including testing)|	Cybersecurity (incl. governance & supply chain)
Incident reporting|	Yes, to financial supervisors|	Yes, to national cybersecurity authorities
Third-party oversight|	Very specific and strict (e.g. cloud)|	General requirements
Enforcement|	Financial supervisors (e.g. ECB)|	National cybersecurity authorities

In short:

* DORA is like a deep dive into cyber resilience for the financial world.
* NIS2 is more like a broad umbrella for general cybersecurity across key sectors in the EU.
